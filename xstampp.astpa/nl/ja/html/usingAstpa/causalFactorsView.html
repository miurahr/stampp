		<h3>Adding a Causal Factor  </h3>
			
			After finishing the Control Structure, each Node of the Control Structure can be used in 
			the Causal Factors Table to add a Causal Factor to it. Press in the column labeled 
			&amp;quotCausal Factor" to do so.  
		  
		<h3>Link a Hazard to a Causal Factor  </h3>
			
			Causal Factors can be linked to Hazards. Press   in the column labeled &amp;quotHazard Links" 
			to do so. It&amp;acutes the same linking procedure as described for the Unsafe Control Actions 
			Table. 
		 
		<h3>Define or Link Safety Constraint corresponding to a Causal Factor  </h3>
			
			New Safety Constraints can be defined for Causal Factors as they can be for Unsafe 
			Control Actions. To do so, press   in the column labeled as &amp;quotSafety Constraint". If this 
			Safety Constraint was already defined in the Corresponding Safety Constraints Table, it 
			should not be defined one more time. Press to link to existing Safety Constraints.
