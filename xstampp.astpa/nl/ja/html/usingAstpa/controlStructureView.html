		<h1>制御構造の作成</h1>
		<h3>制御構造ノード </h3>
			
			Controllers, actuators, controlled processes and sensors are defined as control structure 
			nodes.  They are used for modeling control structures. In order to add a node to control 
			structure, simply drag it from the palette in the right section of the window and drop it 
			to the modeling area in the middle.  Another way of adding nodes is clicking the node in 
			the palette and then clicking on the part of the modeling area where the node should be 
			drawn.  
		  
		<h3>Connections</h3>
			
			Arrows and dashed arrows are defined as connections. They are used to model 
			relationships between control structure nodes. These nodes have to be added to the 
			modeling area before connections between these nodes can be drawn. In order to draw 
			a connections, click on arrow or dashed arrow and available anchor points will appear 
			<img src="../images/componentAnchors.png"> as blue squares on the nodes edges. Every connections starts and ends 
			with an anchor point. They have to be clicked to connect the corresponding nodes.  
		  
		<h3>Text Boxes v</h3>
			
			Text boxes can be used to describe control structures, especially their connections. Text 
			boxes can be added the same way a control structure node is added. 
		 
		<h3>Deleting and Editing Control Structure Elements  </h3>
			
			Nodes, connections and text boxes are defined as control structure elements. A selected 
			element can be deleted by pressing Del (on Windows) or Backspace (on Macintosh) on 
			the Keyboard. Elements can be edited by doubleTclick.
